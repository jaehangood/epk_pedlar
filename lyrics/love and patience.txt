What it had to be, I get it
With confidence I'm calling it a phase, it's a wrap finally
There you see what he went and did to prove himself?
Well I need some time and agency

Take what you can take and leave it 
You gave enough love and patience 
At the end of the road she'll be waiting
Whether it be hell or heaven
Take what you can take and leave it

I'd keep moving for longer
If there's water to fall on, water to fall on
Barely keeping my head above
Best thing I've ever known
Lift me up, get me out of bed

Take what you can take and leave it 
You gave enough love and patience 
At the end of the road she'll be waiting
Whether it be hell or heaven
Take what you can take and leave it

Where your dreams are held, I see it
Dead of night you're still going
Missing out, working out your mind
There you see what he went and did to prove himself?
When in need, you might want to take a moment
