she loves me, loves me not
I go in circles with some same usual questions

what she adores reminds me 
of the things that I don't miss that badly

bored out, stripping wraps(wrapping)
while by the ledge the leaves all grow out

I heard it ring, so I ran along
just to find out where my head goes

there I stop and start looking for
what I lack, what I can’t provide
talk about how much's a healthy amount

then you ask why I went ahead
messed all up, oh that’s petrifying
words don’t always come straight from my mind

there she beams, waving from afar
take a look at how the clouds are parted
just for once can you hear me out

oh she don't seem to want to listen
wonder what she thinks of our chances
all at once rushing at me

she loves me, loves me not
I go in circles with some same usual questions

what she adores reminds me 
of the things that I don't miss that badly

pouring out all your thoughts
is not as easy as it seems to be 

at my hardest trying to seek some peace
how do I find out where my head’s at

there I stop and start looking for
what I lack, what I can’t provide
talk about how much's a healthy amount

then you ask why I went ahead
messed all up, oh that’s petrifying
words don’t always come straight from my mind

there I stop and start looking for
what I lack, what I can’t provide
how much exactly's a healthy amount?

then you say that I complicate
your state of mind no matter how I try
but i just don't understand why and how
