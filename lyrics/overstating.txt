it's impossible that i'm overstating
every word is true, coming straight out of my heart

it's just where we are situated
I know it's not easy but you need to speak your mind 

the tide is running high 
won't you give it a chance

when it's the right season
I'll be standing right here 

we don't have to question
don't have to desire

been trying to move freely
on my own

take it seriously
don't you laugh it off
circumstances
don't let them get in the way
you're the only one I'm passionate about


ooo-
you still live in my head rent-free
ooo-
we could forget about the failures
ooo-
better keep my head on straight
so we don't get lost in the things that we do

it's impossible that i'm overstating
every word is true, coming straight out of my heart

it's just where we are situated
I know it's not easy but you need to speak your mind 

the tide is running high 
won't you give it a chance

when it's the right season
I'll be standing right here 

we don't have to question
don't have to desire
