it's the gap that we've tried to close
it's the moments that we're trying to keep
lately I've been daydreaming about daisies, those daises

ooo
another night I stay up til sunrise

ooo
but it never feels enough

out of sight, way out of sight
minds only race when they're apart
days go by, days do go by
a lot on your plate, know what it's like

out of sight, way out of sight
minds only race when they're apart
better life, a better life
oh you should go seek that, you better go

watching petals fly in the air 
been treading in the water for a bit
don't you see how we fall is just as
cyclical as the seasons change
I don't wanna know how it'll play out

out of sight, way out of sight
minds only race when they're apart
days go by, days do go by
a lot on your plate, know what it's like

out of sight, way out of sight
minds only race when they're apart
better life, a better life
oh you should go seek that, you better go

ooo
thought you'd be free at noon somehow
we don't ever seem to run out of things
busy making up and making amends

ooo
we should vacation right now
somewhere warm, where beaches aren't far 
that rendezvous we planned last time
