always in the heart of the street
looking to just sit and rest
but if you meant to come to me and lend me a hand
is it hard not to hesitate
there's only so much I ask for

heart cold as ice, when you turn and leave
always on the edge is my sanity
indecision keeps me wide awake
I don’t want it

lift me, only higher
til I feel that breeze warm
like I wanted

always in the heart of the street
looking to just sit and rest
but if you meant to come to me and lend me a hand
Is it hard not to hesitate
there's only so much I ask for

maybe on that side of the road
I could spend more time fantasizing about something

night grows dark and cold
can we get through the season once more
waiting out the dusk

always in the heart of the street
looking to just sit and rest
but if you meant to come to me and lend me a hand
is it hard not to hesitate
there's only so much I ask for
