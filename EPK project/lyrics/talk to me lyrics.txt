that just really hurt me
as much as it took a toll on you

killing me quiet silently
sleepless nights on repeat

I strive to stay grounded
what do you refuse to see

got us in such agony 
spare me some room to breathe 

walking with you makes me feel
I’m jumping on a trampoline
would you come and talk to me
swear I’ll take accountability 

desperate like a stranded boat
I can’t stand no silent treatment
can you please just talk to me
I'm sorry if my words came differently 
to you

just a couple notches down
thought we had found our delight
can’t seem to figure out where to start

really do I ask too much
it’s all about miscommunication
I'll be calmly sitting tight
we'll work it out in due time

such a strain you put on me
though I need you now and terribly
would you come and talk to me
swear I’ll take accountability

wander like a forsaken soul
can't take no more silent treatment
can you please just talk to me
I'm sorry if my words came differently 
to you
