I Can Make It Easy For You Fix

if you want it
just come take it
babe I want to
get back to you

long ride had us worn out
wish there was a little more room
the view comes in a flashback
submerged on the wooden floor

I lost all my patience
sitting here and staring out 
when you set in motion
as if you never expected none

baby can we just let go?
all the guilt from the get-go
wash it off, we’ll be better off
if we keep on running back to the start
led astray in the street lights
I will navigate to the door 
 
I can make it easy for you
I can, can make it easy for you
I can make it easy for you
pull it back, it'd be enough for two

I can make it easy for you
I can, can make it easy for you
I can make it easy for you
spiraled back, here we are just two
