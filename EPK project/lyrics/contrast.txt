somewhere on the edge of our consciousness
you are not afraid of what you’re not aware
I swear you’ll spend the whole day and night awake
leave behind your thoughts on the ashtray

doused in dopamine, had no brakes
I can barely smell and taste
It don’t matter how we interpret what’s being said

somehow on the fence there you still lay
you don't seem so sure of things that I suggest
far from my intent, don't play with no substance
slowly get immersed that's all it takes

motions flooding fill up the space
heavenly fountain keeps it drenched
down below I will be praising your divine contrast

more or less far beyond our grasp
filled to the brim, full of airiness
feel it warming up through my veins
the hill still glistens after the rains

the warmth will take it all over
along with our sanity
won’t you pull me a little closer
serenely just breathe it in
