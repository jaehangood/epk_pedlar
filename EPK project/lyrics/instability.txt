flourishing and sprawling
we had it through the stages
it don’t need to be done quickly, so quickly 

when little things about you start to slip my mind
I let you down, you say you're alright
but I know what kind of face you make to my instability 

hated seeing you walking out the door
saying things to put my mind at ease
how I count the hours since I’ve hit my capacity

and you don’t seem to be much shaken
you don’t seem to be much 

flourishing and sprawling
we had it through the stages
it don’t need to be done quickly, so quickly 

when little things about you start to slip my mind
I let you down, you say you're alright
but I know what kind of face you make to my instability 

then little things between us start to break apart, get magnified, wonder why
oh I despise that kind of look you gave to my instability
