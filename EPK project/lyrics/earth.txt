borderline fixation
favored by a few
aren't we all sinners
I'm talking about us two
 
that's all that matters
but we couldn't be bound to 
the ground, soon we'll come back to earth

Is that all you want?
Is that everything you want?
not that I don't see your side
I've been there you've seen my side
oh I wish you wanted more

maybe it's not the worst you've run into
maybe we should all go off the grid and live 
a life where we're fine with what is given
